o create a simple webpage with the title "Riesgos Demo", you'll need an HTML file and optionally a JavaScript file. Here's the code for both:

1. Create an HTML file (index.html):

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Riesgos Demo</title>
    <script src="main.js" defer></script>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Riesgos Demo</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

2. Create a JavaScript file (main.js):

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    console.log('Riesgos Demo page loaded');
});
```

To launch the webpage, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. The JavaScript code in `main.js` will run when the page is loaded, and you'll see the message "Riesgos Demo page loaded" in the browser console.

These two files are the minimum required to create and launch a simple webpage with the title "Riesgos Demo". You can expand the functionality and design by adding more HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as needed.
